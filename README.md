# Federated Learning Pipeline for Prostate Cancer Detection (PiCAI)

This repository contains the code to train a federated learning model using [NVIDIA FLARE](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare) for prostate cancer detection. The setup follows a semi-supervised federated learning scheme over 5 simulated clients.

### 1. Setup Environment
Make sure you are in a python virtual environment using the appropriate Python module and set your `PYTHONPATH`:

```bash
source ~/env/prostate-env/bin/activate
module load Python/3.10.8-GCCcore-12.2.0
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### 2. Install the Requirements
Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
```bash
pip install nvflare==2.5.1
pip install torch==1.13.1+cu117 torchvision==0.14.1+cu117 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
cd prostate
pip install -r flare_requirements.txt
```
### 3. Preprocessing and Classification
Follow instructions in the original [ITUNet-for-PICAI-2022-Challenge](https://github.com/Yukiya-Umimi/ITUNet-for-PICAI-2022-Challenge/tree/main) to run preprocessing and classification steps. These are prerequisites before proceeding to FL training.

### 4. Generate Federated Client Splits
Run the following script to split your data among clients (run this script whenever you change the number of clients):
```bash
python generate_split.py --num_clients 5 --data_path /path/to/data
```
**Arguments**:
- num_clients: Number of simulated clients (default = 5)
- data_path: Path to the local dataset directory

### 5. Configure Federated Learning Job
Structure of the project is shown below, customise the config 
```bash
  prostate/prostate_2D/job_configs/picai_fedsemi/
  ├── app/
  │   └── config/
  │       ├── config_fed_client.json
  │       └── config_fed_server.json
  └── meta.json
```
**Update these files to:**
- Adjust number of clients, learning rate, epochs, etc.
- Match client site names in meta.json with the expected setup.
- Change path to the data root and split.json within config_fed_client.json.

### 6. Run FL Simulation
To start the FL simulation using NVIDIA FLARE from within prostate/prostate_2D/job_configs/picai_fedsemi/:
```bash
nvflare simulator . \
  -w ./workspace_picai_fedsemi \
  -n 5 \
  -t 5 \
  -gpu 0
```

**Options (Ensure the number of clients listed here matches the value specified in the configuration):**
- -w: Path to the workspace
- -n: Number of clients
- -t: Number of threads
- -gpu: GPU to use for training

### 7. Inference: Detection Phase
After training completes, you’ll get FL_global_model.pt from the server within the workspace (inside server). Use this model for inference from prostate_2D directory:
```bash
python prostate_2D/inference_seg_fl.py
```
This generates predictions needed for the detection phase of the challenge. Use the output for the detection phase mentioned in [ITUNet-for-PICAI-2022-Challenge](https://github.com/Yukiya-Umimi/ITUNet-for-PICAI-2022-Challenge/tree/main/segmentation)
